# Relayer Contract

A smart contract acting as a relayer for interacting with Ethereum nodes via JSON-RPC.

## Overview

The primary motivation for creating such a contract is to provide a flexible and secure way for smart contracts and applications to interact with the Ethereum blockchain without managing their own nodes. The contract can be deployed on the Ethereum network, and other contracts or applications can interact with it to perform various tasks like reading blockchain data or sending transactions.

The functionalities provided by the RelayerContract can be especially useful in cases where:

    The deploying entity wants to use Ethereum nodes hosted by different providers for redundancy and decentralization.
    Smart contracts want to interact with the Ethereum blockchain but are unable to manage their own nodes due to gas costs, complexity, or other limitations.
    A contract wants to use multiple nodes for improved reliability and to avoid single points of failure.
