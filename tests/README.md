use Truffle as the development framework and Ganache as the local Ethereum blockchain for testing. Make sure you have Truffle and Ganache installed before proceeding.

Step 1: Set up the Project
Create a new directory for the project and initialize a Truffle project inside it:

bash

mkdir relayer-demo
cd relayer-demo
truffle init

Step 2: Contract Implementation
Replace the contracts/Migrations.sol file with the RelayerContract.sol code provided earlier in this conversation.

Step 3: Truffle Configuration
In the truffle-config.js (or truffle.js) file, ensure the Ganache network configuration is set up correctly:

javascript

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*", // Match any network ID
    },
  },
};

Step 4: Deploy the Contract
Create a new migration file in the migrations/ folder:

javascript

// migrations/2_deploy_relayer_contract.js
const RelayerContract = artifacts.require("RelayerContract");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(RelayerContract);
};

Now, deploy the contract to your local Ganache blockchain:

bash

truffle migrate --reset --network development

Step 5: Interacting with the Contract
In this demonstration, we'll create a simple Node.js script to interact with the deployed RelayerContract. Create a new file named relay.js in the project root and add the following code:
